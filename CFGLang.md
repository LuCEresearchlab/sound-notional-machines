I have kempe - the backend is the interesting part I guess
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/kempe

It has blocks, it's effectful, it has no loops (just recursion) though.

I have https://github.com/bollu/tiny-optimising-compiler which implements a
tiny compiler for SSA. It has everything you ask for. It generates MIPS
asm, so it performs register allocation as well.

Hello Igor,

There is an implementation of a subset of Tcl in Haskell. Not sure if this is
what you need, but I tried playing with it some years ago and found it
interesting.

I wonder if something from The Programming Languages Zoo would be helpful:

  https://plzoo.andrej.com/

Itâ€™s in OCaml but might be a good starting point.

It's dynamically typed, not sure you want that, and maybe overkill wrt features. Pending 0.3 release, which has a lot changed since 0.1 and 0.2. The latest branch may appear a bit more stable than the 0.3 branch, yet unrelease anyway.

The most up-to-date material wrt the language part, from the upcoming 0.3 release is here: https://github.com/complyue/tour/blob/master/lang/grammar.edh

This grammar chapter is considered almost done while other chapters still wip. 

Best read experience with Gitpod or VSCode as described in https://github.com/complyue/tour

to me, Haskell

I have an implementation of a language that has all the features you mention (ints + booleans, assignment, arithmetic and logic operators, if statements, while and repeat loops, blocks), which I have used in my Programming Languages class.  It also has a typechecker.  It is interpreted --- not sure if that is OK or if you are looking for something with a compiler.  I would be happy to send it to you privately off-list if it sounds like it might fit the bill.
